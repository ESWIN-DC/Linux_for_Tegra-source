This README provides an overview of the luks-srv TA, which is intended
to be used for hardware-based passphrase generation.

luks-srv TA Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The luks-srv TA generates a hardware-based passphrase which the LUKS
utility uses to unlock the encrypted disks in the nonsecure world.
There are two parts to the TA. The first part is the process of
deriving the EKB key from the hwkey-agent TA. The second part is
using the derived keys to generate passphrase.

The key derivation flow is:
 1. The luks-srv TA queries EKB key and ECID (embedded chip ID) from
    the hwkey-agent TA. The ECID is a unique per-chip ID in the fuse.
    This can help to derive a unique per-device key.
 2. Derive a unique per-device LUKS key:
    luks_key_unique =  KDF(ekb_key,
                           label_str="luks-srv-ecid",
                           context_str="${ECID}")
 3. Derive a generic LUKS key:
    luks_key_generic = KDF(ekb_key,
                           label_str="luks-srv-generic",
                           context_str="generic-key")
The KDF (Key Derivation Function) is NIST-SP-800-108.

The luks-srv TA generates the key pairs of both keys above. The
difference between the two types of keys is that the generic key is
the same for any devices that use the same EKB-based key, while the
per-device unique key is the unique key on each of the devices.
You can choose which key to use depending on the use case.

The passphrase generation flow is:
 1. The luks-srv TA uses the derived keys to generate the passphrase.
 2. Generate the passphrase:
    passphrase = KDF(luks_key,
                     label_str="luks-srv-passphrase",
                     context_str="disk's UUID or user's input str")

The userspace CA can query the passphrase for the LUKS utilities to
unlock the encrypted disk.
