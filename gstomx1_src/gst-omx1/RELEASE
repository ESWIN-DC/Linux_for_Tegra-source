Release notes for GStreamer OpenMAX IL wrapper plugin 1.0.0

The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new feature release
in the 1.x stable series of the GStreamer OpenMAX IL
wrapper plugin.


The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.10.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.10.x series and
will not affect an existing 0.10.x installation.



This module contains a plugin that wraps available OpenMAX IL
components and makes them available as standard GStreamer
elements.



Other modules containing plugins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plugins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
